Services are used in docker for scaling applications purposes, Services do work in Docker swarm env.

Each service can find itself if on same network created by docker, which is part of service discovery.

New networks can be created and managed by docker network command.

If in swarm there are total of 5 systems out of which on two the application is running on port 80, when accessed from outside the swarm it shows the application running anyway despite the fact that application is running only on two systems out of 5 because of load balancing implemented by default in docker swarm.

Docker has bridge network be default enabled in docker networking, it is called as NAT in case of windows.

Second is overlay networking, in this, you can map multiple containers under one single network, they are reachable to each other via overlay network.

if one wants to use his containers as live machines on existing VLANS then MACVLAN is the choice, this gives every container its own MAC and IP address on existing VLAN thus they act as live machines, promiscious mode is pre requesite.
